# Sentiment Analysis Classifier & Amazon Review Star Rating Prediction 

This project contains a Hive and Python based sentiment classifier that is meant to be run on data stored in a Hadoop DFS cluster. 

The classifier was first developed using homework review data and then was extended to run on an AWS instance to classify Amazon reviews by predicted star rating.

The classifier is 60% - 75% accurate (assume humans are 80% accurate) with variance due to the quality of ground truth training labels.
When labels are entirely accurate, model accuracy is 75%.
