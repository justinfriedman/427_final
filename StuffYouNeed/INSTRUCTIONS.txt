1. Run the "filter_reviews.py" script to generate the hw_reviews.txt file
2. Run the commands in the create_review_table.hql script
    * make sure you run the hadoop fs -put command in a different terminal in the SAME directory
3. Then run the commands in the preprocess.hql file, which will generate a table called "preprocessed_reviews"
4. Run the commands in the "basic_sentiment_ownlabels.hql" script, which will generate a table called "review_scores_ownlabels". This table has the schema (semester, hw_id, hw_number, our classification, score)

Note: the files "filter_words.py" and "basic_sentiment.hql" are used to compare our predictions with the ground truth. "basic_sentiment.hql" creates a table in the form (semester, hw_id, hw_number, label, score, match), where "label" is the ground truth label, and "match" is either True or False, depending on if our classification matches her label.
